# the why

- the US [babynames packages](https://github.com/hadley/babynames) created by Hadley has an average of 98 downloads a day, and 15 downloads in Australia every 10 days. 
- Great dataset for demonstration and teaching: 
    - everyone has a name
    - non-political 
    - contains geospatial information (state) 
    - contains time data (years) 
    - the data is well recorded and maintained
    - fun

# step 1: Australian open data portal


1. Australian Gov [Open Data Portal](https://search.data.gov.au/).

# step 1: Australian open data portal

> 1. no nationa data set
> 2. some missing
> 3. different formats
> 4. different years
> 5. some with counts some with proportions
> 6. inconsistena and poor labelling of files

# step 2: state by state

.centre["The Births, Deaths & Marriages Registries will have this available. After all, that's their primary job, and Australia signed the Open Data Charter in 2017"] 

Australian Open Data Charter states that government data should be: 
>  1. Open by defailt
>  2. Timely and comprehensive
>  3. Accessible and usable
>  4. Comparable and interoperable
>  5. For improved governance and citizen engagement 
>  6. For inclusive development and innovation

# Summary

1. we finished it - but not before lunchtime.
2. Australia's Open Data portal is not so 'open'. 
3. next step: write a post-mortem of our journey through Australian open data as a blog post, report or article.
4. audit the QLD Open Data Portal for adherence to the Australian Open Data Charter.
