## Example usage

```{r example-plot}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ozbabynames_1952_top_10 <- ozbabynames |>
  filter(year == 1952) |>
  group_by(sex, name) |>
  summarise(count = sum(count)) |>
  arrange(-count) |>
  top_n(10) |>
  ungroup()

ggplot(
  ozbabynames_1952_top_10,
  aes(
    x = reorder(name, count),
    y = count,
    group = sex
  )
) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(sex ~ .,
    scales = "free_y"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Name") +
  ggtitle("Top ten male and female names in 1952")
```

And let's look at the popularity of the package author names, "Rob", "Mitchell", "Nicholas", and "Jessie", as well as some similar names.

```{r explore-author-names, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
author_names <- c("Robin", "Robert", "Mitchell", "Nicholas", "Jessie", "Jessica")

ozbabynames |>
  filter(name %in% author_names) |>
  group_by(name, year) |>
  summarise(count = sum(count)) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = count,
    colour = name
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~name,
    scales = "free_y"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

And let's see that animated

```{r animate-explore-author-names, cache=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gganimate)

ozbabynames |>
  filter(name %in% author_names) |>
  count(name, year, wt = count) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = n,
    colour = name,
    group = name,
    label = name,
    fill = name
  )) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_label(colour = "white", alpha = 0.75, size = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    title = element_text(
      colour = "purple",
      size = 20,
      face = "bold"
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "number of bubs dubbed in {frame_along} ",
    y = "n babies"
  ) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  transition_reveal(along = year)
```


## Known Issues

The coverage is very uneven, with some states only providing very recent data, and some states only providing the top 50 or 100 names. The ACT does not provide counts, and so no ACT data are included. South Australia has by far the best data, with full coverage of all names back to 1944.
